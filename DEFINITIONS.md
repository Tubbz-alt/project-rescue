## Blocker
A blocker is anything that prevents a task from being able to be worked on or 
that prevents a team from being able to work and/or be productive. Blockers
immediately change the "Mood" to "Sad" and raise flags for the team leaders to
work with the team to clear the issue.

## Pushed
When a story / task is moved from one Sprint to a later Sprint it is referred to
as being "pushed" across Sprints.

## Deficit
When calculating resource availability, the "deficit" refers to the gap between
available time / resources for a team and the scheduled / scoped work for that
same team. Deficit plays a role in calculating _Risk_ levels.

## Incidents
Events that happen throughout the lifecycle of a project that impact the team's
ability to meet goals and perform work. Incidents are not project-specific, but
are rather environmental, organizational or technological events that block a
team's ability to be productive. Examples include internet outages, VPN issues,
resource availability, dependency failures, etc. Incidents are tracked on the 
Incidents tab in the master spreadsheet and log issues in order to identify
common problems or recurring issues that need further root-cause analysis.
